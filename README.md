### Data
Risk ratios and standard errors are provided in the file, "effect_measures.xlsx"
Risk ratios were either provided by studies or calculated in Excel using raw case counts provided in the studies.
Standard errors were calculated in Excel using provided or calculated risk ratios.

### Meta-Analysis
After conducting a systematic review, four studies were included in the meta-analyses. Three meta-analyses were conducted, each including 3-4 studies. Meta-analyses examined the risk between Hispanic/Latinx persons vs. White persons, Black/African American persons vs. White persons, and Asian persons vs. White persons, respectively. Hispanic/Latinx persons were found to be at significantly higher risk of community acquired third-generation cephalosporin-resistant uropathogens compared to White persons.
